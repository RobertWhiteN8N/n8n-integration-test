To create a Playwright-based automation script in JavaScript, using the Page Object Model for the provided test case, you would need the following details:

1. **Test Title, Preconditions, Test Steps, and Expected Results**:** These details seem to be missing from your message. Please provide the complete test case description including:
   - Test Title
   - Preconditions
   - Detailed Test Steps with Expected Results for each step

Once you provide this information, I can assist you with creating a Playwright script in JavaScript that reflects these test case details. The script will utilize the Page Object Model to ensure modularity and maintainability.
